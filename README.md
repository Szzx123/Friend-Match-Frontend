## Introduction

This is a mobile site based on Vue3 + SpringBoot2, which is a learning platform. It is a learning platform for computer science students. When registering, users can choose their own tags, such as the programming language they are good at and the technology they like, and our platform provides corresponding functions such as user management, searching users by tags, recommending similar users, and forming teams. We also collect programming learning resources and display them on the platform to provide free learning resources for students who want to learn skills in a particular area. 

Our vision is that through this platform, users can find their partners with the same skills and preferences, and exchange contact information and form teams to learn and communicate together. Users can also find the learning resources they need to study.
